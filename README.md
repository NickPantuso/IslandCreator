# IslandCreator
Once you open the GUI, you'll be able to type anything you want under 'input,' however, the program will only let you create islands if the input contains nothing else but 0s and 1s. Once you fill the input entirely with 1s and 0s, you can click 'Create Map ->.' This will send your 1s and 0s to the output section, color code them, and count how many islands (1s surrounded by 0s) there are on your map. You can then choose to either reset the input and output, or you can save the map. By saving a map, you enter it into a queue which you can view by clicking 'Load Island Maps.' The load button opens a different GUI that lets you traverse through all the maps you've saved. Note: The reset button will not delete any saved maps.

# What was learned?

* Usage of data structures and/or algorithms (depth first search, 2D arrays, queues)
* Intermediate GUI skills (Using a variety of listeners, text manipulation, buttons that open other GUIs)
